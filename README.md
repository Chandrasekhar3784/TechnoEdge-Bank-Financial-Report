## Project Insights

- The largest customer segment falls within the 36–45 age group, followed by the 26–35 age group.
- Customers with business accounts contribute the highest balance (6.7M) while the rest drop sharply in the self-employed customers.
- Current accounts (CA) dominate the balance portfolio, while savings (SA) and certificates of deposit (CD) lag behind 7M.
- Balance amounts peak in April (7M) and are lowest in February (2M), indicating potential seasonal financial behavior.
  
## Final Conclusion:

The dashboard indicates that business professionals and married customers are the major contributors to the portfolio balance.
There are opportunities to engage underrepresented demographics-majority-spans across the age groups of younger and older populations. Current account dependency has to be prompted by offering savings and long-term investment products.
